2
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:21,643
- I'm gonna win!
- No...

3
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,550
This one's on me, well...

4
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,398
Look at the dolphins.

5
00:03:19,434 --> 00:03:21,591
Theo Weston lived a life...

6
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:25,066
Was of great benefit to his community
and to his family.

7
00:03:25,186 --> 00:03:28,892
And our hearts go out to Lil and Ian
at this time.

8
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:56,960
It turn out?

9
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,385
Yeah, well you know...

10
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,464
You give the people what they want...

11
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,184
I'm sorry but you know what?
I just never really got the point of Theo.

12
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:09,016
Well, I can't said that it was
a huge surprise...

13
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:11,998
Or I wouldn't take a drive with him
anywhere if I could avoid it.

14
00:04:12,028 --> 00:04:14,491
He thought speed limits are for pufftas.

15
00:04:27,626 --> 00:04:29,451
The boy's taking it very hard.

16
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:48,817
Are you okay?

17
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,082
Yeah.

18
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,723
Darling...

19
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,399
- Hey.
- Hey.

20
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:04,106
Where's mom?

21
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,225
With Lil.

22
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:18,328
I think you should take Ian down the beach.

23
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:24,124
Come on Ian,
do you want to go down to the beach?

24
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:25,243
Let's go.

25
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:28,617
Let's get our stuff.

26
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,990
Hey, you want to catch some blue crabs?

27
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:32,542
Yeah, sure.

28
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:08,042
God, Lil look at that...

29
00:07:10,408 --> 00:07:12,107
Did we do that?

30
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:14,830
We must have been.

31
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,944
We certainly did.

32
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,002
They're beautiful.

33
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:25,909
They're like young gods.

34
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:33,161
Amazing.

35
00:07:34,142 --> 00:07:35,356
Yeah.

36
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,475
We did all right.

37
00:07:58,335 --> 00:07:59,791
You had a good day?

38
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,919
Great

39
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:02,809
Are you hungry?

40
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,016
Starving.

41
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,187
Ravenous.

42
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,682
Won't be a tick.

43
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:30,146
What is that?

44
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:31,889
I look like an angry boy.

45
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:33,861
With that chin.

46
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:36,931
That's horrible.

47
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:39,206
Oh yeah that one, yeah...

48
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:41,502
I'm pretty happy with that.

49
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:44,156
Yeah, it's nice but not in
the same league.

50
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,408
- Really? As those two?
- Yeah.

51
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,896
- No way.
- Right?

52
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,367
There's something about them.

53
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:51,967
- I don't know.
- It's like sort of an unearthly aura.

54
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:56,647
What's that?

55
00:08:57,795 --> 00:09:00,220
They're looking at pictures of themselves
as nimfits...

56
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:02,183
They're admiring their own beauty.

57
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,949
Let's have a look.

58
00:09:04,994 --> 00:09:07,414
- Hey!
- Give it back!

59
00:09:07,473 --> 00:09:09,791
Hold on.

60
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:13,533
Come one, give us a break.
It was a long time ago.

61
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:18,008
Time flies, doesn't it?
I'll tell you though...

62
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,612
We may have been prettier then, but...

63
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,987
- I think we have much more character now.
- You know what?

64
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:22,523
Yeah.

65
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:24,125
- She might be right.
- Yeah, that's...

66
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:26,096
That's true.

67
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:29,149
Well...

68
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,790
Here's to our mothers.

69
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,320
Thank you, my darling.

70
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:42,469
- Come on, Tom. Give me a hand.
- Okay.

71
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:51,297
Are you alright?

72
00:09:51,355 --> 00:09:53,198
Yeah, I'm fine mom.

73
00:09:57,076 --> 00:09:58,224
Dinner's ready.

74
00:10:00,937 --> 00:10:05,340
Remember that time when you had boobs
and I didn't? And I was...

75
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,007
Well, you soon made up for it.

76
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:10,599
It never stopped the boys from
buzzing around you, did it?

77
00:10:10,646 --> 00:10:13,718
Yeah, but the boring jocks you never had
anything to say.

78
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:16,343
You had the interesting guys,
with long hair...

79
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:20,881
They wrote poetry and smoked the old...

80
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:24,260
Mine were just dull.

81
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:26,892
They still are, aren't they?

82
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:28,504
The good Saul.

83
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,259
Come on, he's not so much dull as...

84
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,260
He's just... Persistent.

85
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:36,827
I want to know more about your boobs.

86
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:39,604
Well, it was quite serious and...

87
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:42,628
But Roz, she was very very comforting.
She used to say...

88
00:10:42,669 --> 00:10:45,405
Don't worry, pop this in your bra
and they'll be coming along soon.

89
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:46,469
And so they were.

90
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:49,046
Right Tom,
I think that's enough on this topic.

91
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,246
I don't think it's entirely exhausted.

92
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:55,572
One queen.

93
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:57,032
And the king.

94
00:10:57,768 --> 00:10:59,016
- Ace.
- Cheat.

95
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,501
It's your face.
It's always your face.

96
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:06,902
I don't want to play anymore,
I don't like it now.

97
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:08,504
- Hey.
- Hi.

98
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,972
- You're very late.
- It was a big day.

99
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,249
- In what way?
- I'll explain later.

100
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,400
If you're hungry, we ate all of yours.

101
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,805
- Nah, there's plenty more in the kitchen.
- No rush

102
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:19,239
My turn to shuffle.

103
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:21,490
I'm done.
Taking off.

104
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:23,079
Mom.

105
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:25,164
Early start.
Are you coming?

106
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:26,875
Well...

107
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:28,831
We're gonna watch a movie.

108
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,699
Alright.
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

109
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,661
Alright.

110
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,372
Good night.

111
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:38,180
Thanks boys for cleaning up.
Very nice...

112
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:40,268
- No worries.
- No worries.

113
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:58,175
Well?

114
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,960
I've been offered a job.

115
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:06,413
What?

116
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:11,093
Senior lecturer in drama
at Sidney University.

117
00:12:11,332 --> 00:12:12,844
Sidney?

118
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,722
It's a great department.

119
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:18,182
It's quite a salary hike.

120
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:21,251
Right?

121
00:12:22,913 --> 00:12:24,556
Sounds like you want to take it.

122
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,684
Yeah, well...

123
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:28,782
Yes, I do.
Of course I do.

124
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:29,989
Yes.

125
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,212
And...

126
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:33,962
How would that work?

127
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,912
Would you fly back on the weekends?

128
00:12:35,946 --> 00:12:39,329
No, I thought you and Tom
would come with me...

129
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:41,777
You mean move?

130
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,079
Move from here?

131
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:45,638
Yeah, I know it's not gonna be easy.

132
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:48,482
No.

133
00:12:49,764 --> 00:12:53,378
Darling, opportunities like these certainly
don't come along very often.

134
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,768
You must have applied for this job, Harold.

135
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:06,434
Yeah.

136
00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:16,254
You never discussed it with me.

137
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:22,163
I didn't think I was gonna get it.
Not in a million years.

138
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,349
Roz?

139
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,556
Yeah?

140
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:33,651
Are you okay?

141
00:14:41,377 --> 00:14:42,911
Should I close the door?

142
00:14:43,477 --> 00:14:44,657
No.

143
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,423
Lil!

144
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:02,550
Hi, Saul.

145
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,103
- Oh Roz hi.
- Hi Saul.

146
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:07,405
Didn't see you there.

147
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:09,772
How are you?
What can I do for you?

148
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:13,789
Well, I took the liberty of organizing
a little surprise.

149
00:15:13,932 --> 00:15:16,800
A celebration dinner tonight
at The Japanese.

150
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:19,337
Celebrating what?

151
00:15:21,117 --> 00:15:22,420
My birthday.

152
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,902
Happy birthday, Saul.

153
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,002
Yeah, happy birthday.

154
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:30,507
But I can't tonight, cause...

155
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,598
We've got the book club.

156
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:34,057
Really?

157
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:36,553
You couldn't skip it just once?

158
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:39,254
I wish I could.

159
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:41,211
I'm doing the food.

160
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,157
Oh, I see.

161
00:15:46,073 --> 00:15:47,389
Maybe another night.

162
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,360
Yeah, another night.

163
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:51,658
- I'll give you a bell.
- Great.

164
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:53,554
Bye.

165
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:56,602
Book club?

166
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,435
You are really good liar.

167
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:03,276
Really good.

168
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,461
Okay, let's deal with it one at a time.

169
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:13,164
You could get someone
to manage the gallery...

170
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:16,152
Or you could open a similar place
down in Sidney.

171
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:19,772
It's not as simple as that, Harold.

172
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:23,366
Yeah, agreed but for Tom?

173
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:27,370
And what he wants to do...
This isn't the place.

174
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:34,911
He's bound to take some
time to organized, you know?

175
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:36,091
Yeah.

176
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:37,364
But...

177
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:42,502
The point is that I need a wife...

178
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:44,261
Permanent wife.

179
00:16:44,773 --> 00:16:46,836
You've got one, Harold.

180
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,325
I'm up for 20 years now, you know.

181
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:50,941
I do.

182
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:56,621
It's just I don't get to
see you much lately.

183
00:16:57,207 --> 00:17:00,784
And when I do, it's like you're on loan.

184
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,441
What?

185
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,472
I think it's Lil you don't want to leave.

186
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,116
Are you saying we're lesbians?

187
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:13,660
No, not that it'd make any difference.

188
00:17:13,998 --> 00:17:15,832
You're just mad.

189
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:19,269
Of course I'm gonna come with you,
what do you think...

190
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,035
I just need time to get used to the idea,
that's all.

191
00:17:25,316 --> 00:17:27,628
I don't know what he's talking about.

192
00:17:28,018 --> 00:17:30,923
He says my real relationship
is isn't with him.

193
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,171
It's with you.

194
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,043
How can he think that?

195
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:35,537
I know...

196
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:37,251
We make him feel excluded.

197
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:39,828
Oh my god, that's how I always felt.

198
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:41,841
Even when Theo was alive, with his...

199
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:46,260
Business trips and his girlfriends
ringing the house and his moods...

200
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,359
You don't know how much
I used to envy you guys.

201
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,222
He always seems so content.

202
00:17:52,263 --> 00:17:54,111
Well, we were.

203
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,459
He's not saying we're lezzos.

204
00:18:00,939 --> 00:18:02,453
Not exactly.

205
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,135
My hat!

206
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,440
Go on!

207
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,863
We're not lezzos!

208
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,511
Are we?

209
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:24,887
I don't think so.

210
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:27,531
Not as far as I remember.

211
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,532
We're just best friends.

212
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:32,530
That's right.

213
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:33,710
Right.

214
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:39,700
I do remember that...

215
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:42,107
Time that you...

216
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:44,713
Well, it was...

217
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:46,943
Remember?
That kiss?

218
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,703
Oh my God...

219
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:54,806
- But we had to practice on someone.
- Right.

220
00:18:56,648 --> 00:18:58,168
Does it make us...

221
00:18:58,355 --> 00:18:59,494
No...

222
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:04,159
- Bloody men!
- Bloody men.

223
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,688
You'll see, it's a much better
director's program down there.

224
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:19,859
I mean not to mention the standard
of teaching, once you get going.

225
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,177
That goes without saying.

226
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:26,391
- Alright.
- Alright.

227
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:28,212
- Look after her.
- Will do.

228
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:32,549
Don't try and be macho and drive
too many hours of that, rest okay?

229
00:19:33,054 --> 00:19:34,451
I'm gonna miss you.

230
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,701
It's only a couple of weeks.

231
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:27,048
I didn't know you were out here.

232
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,968
Hey.

233
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,253
Mind if I join you?

234
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:33,162
Of course not.

235
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,111
Give us a drag.

236
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:45,321
You can have a whole one
if you promised to behave yourself.

237
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:47,694
A drag will do.

238
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:52,475
I didn't know you smoke.

239
00:20:53,811 --> 00:20:55,966
I don't, I gave up years ago.

240
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,997
Now I feel really sinful.

241
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:10,392
Nothing wrong with that.

242
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,545
How are you?

243
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,297
Fine.

244
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:01,848
You know, you're right.

245
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,789
You might have to said yes,
he's a well set out bloke...

246
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,165
No, it doesn't mean I
have to go out with him.

247
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,150
Can't he take a hint?

248
00:22:09,225 --> 00:22:10,725
Evidently not.

249
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,522
I got a suggestion.

250
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:13,729
What?

251
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:15,789
Tell him to go fuck himself.

252
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:20,018
Supposed he doesn't know how.

253
00:22:24,493 --> 00:22:26,334
Love this song.

254
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:40,024
Yeah.

255
00:22:48,892 --> 00:22:52,254
That's the worst dancing I've ever seen.

256
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:20,249
Can you dance?

257
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:54,037
I'm gonna slip away.

258
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,078
I think Tom's had a little bit
too much to drink.

259
00:23:57,124 --> 00:23:58,331
Really?

260
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:01,059
Is he misbehaving?

261
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,865
No, he's fine.

262
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:05,770
But Ian's gonna stay over and
make sure he's alright.

263
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:07,223
Okay.

264
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,038
See you tomorrow.

265
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,077
Where's Tom?

266
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,220
Throwing up, I reckon.

267
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,133
Are you alright, mate?

268
00:24:41,726 --> 00:24:44,529
Yeah, I'm fine.

269
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,332
- Need a hand?
- No, I'm alright.

270
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:47,450
Come on.

271
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:49,585
I said I'm alright.
That's fine.

272
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:50,836
Alright.

273
00:24:51,463 --> 00:24:53,816
- I'll tuck you in.
- No fucking way.

274
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:56,111
Careful, careful.
Slow down.

275
00:24:56,158 --> 00:24:57,263
- You're alright?
- Yeah.

276
00:24:57,324 --> 00:24:58,518
Yeah?

277
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:01,732
It's alright, we're good.

278
00:25:33,272 --> 00:25:35,018
You have everything you need?

279
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:39,604
No.

280
00:29:05,196 --> 00:29:06,321
Hi.

281
00:29:07,173 --> 00:29:08,414
Hi.

282
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:10,118
I don't think he's here.

283
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:12,015
I didn't come to see Ian.

284
00:29:14,093 --> 00:29:15,587
You better come in.

285
00:29:16,787 --> 00:29:19,269
I don't really wanna go to Sidney.

286
00:29:19,628 --> 00:29:21,954
But Dad seems to have it all worked out.

287
00:29:22,172 --> 00:29:24,047
I just don't...

288
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:26,308
Really see how I can get out of it.

289
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,422
Do you want to get out of it?

290
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:35,357
I don't really want to live here.

291
00:29:38,307 --> 00:29:39,875
- No.
- No.

292
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:42,146
God no...

293
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:50,868
We'd really miss you.

294
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:53,248
And I'd miss you.

295
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:56,028
Tom!
Christ!

296
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,563
I'm sorry.

297
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,383
You really shouldn't have done that.

298
00:30:01,615 --> 00:30:02,842
I know.

299
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:07,793
I mean, supposed Ian had walked in or...

300
00:30:07,835 --> 00:30:09,915
Is that all you're worried about?

301
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:13,195
No, I... I just...

302
00:30:16,311 --> 00:30:18,124
Ian's other ways engaged...

303
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:24,256
What does that mean?

304
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:27,543
Means last night I went out to
the kitchen for a drink and...

305
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:30,228
Caught my mother coming out
of his bedroom.

306
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:33,358
- What?
- With her jeans in her hand.

307
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:37,472
It's not funny, Tom.

308
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,259
It's impossible.

309
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:17,545
She's known him since he was a baby.

310
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:22,516
They're probably been thinking about it
for quite a while.

311
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:25,414
Wouldn't you say?

312
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:49,885
- Are you coming?
- Not today.

313
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:53,515
- Are you alright?
- Fine.

314
00:33:18,136 --> 00:33:19,552
You again.

315
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:21,111
Afraid so.

316
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:35,507
I don't really want to
go back there tonight.

317
00:33:36,991 --> 00:33:38,832
Can I please stay here?

318
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:42,781
Yeah.

319
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:45,986
Yes, of course.

320
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:08,115
Hi.
Where have you been?

321
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:11,820
At Lil's.

322
00:37:12,425 --> 00:37:15,161
Doing to her what Ian's been doing to you.

323
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:07,212
We'll finished this later, okay?

324
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,187
I don't know, Lil what have we done?

325
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:22,428
Crossed the line.

326
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:26,285
It can't happen again.

327
00:38:28,543 --> 00:38:30,642
No, no I supposed it can't.

328
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:32,492
No, of course it can't.

329
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:42,033
It's Roz who wants to stop.

330
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,373
She came to see me.

331
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:46,395
What did she say?

332
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:50,770
It doesn't matter, does it darling?

333
00:38:51,406 --> 00:38:53,620
It's just obvious.

334
00:38:53,837 --> 00:38:56,890
The whole thing is unacceptable.

335
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,677
I love her.

336
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:47,911
It's over, Ian.

337
00:40:48,432 --> 00:40:49,778
No.

338
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,778
Please, don't.

339
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:39,009
You have to leave.

340
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,266
You have to leave.

341
00:44:04,691 --> 00:44:06,570
How are you feeling?

342
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:12,989
Good.

343
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:15,736
Yeah...

344
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:18,539
Me too.

345
00:44:19,202 --> 00:44:20,449
Yeah.

346
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:26,836
In fact, I...

347
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,398
I can't remember being this happy.

348
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,206
I know.

349
00:44:40,566 --> 00:44:42,039
It's scary.

350
00:44:43,008 --> 00:44:44,515
Very.

351
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:49,003
I don't want to stop.

352
00:44:53,951 --> 00:44:56,416
I don't see why we have to.

353
00:44:58,712 --> 00:45:01,312
I'm sure they'll get bored
of us soon enough.

354
00:45:03,885 --> 00:45:05,515
Bound to.

355
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:12,736
Hey!

356
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:14,099
You're alright?

357
00:45:14,558 --> 00:45:16,920
It's a long drive, but...

358
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:19,530
I got you an interview...

359
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:21,423
You'll be going down next week.

360
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,377
Great.

361
00:45:26,742 --> 00:45:28,389
You've changed.

362
00:45:28,673 --> 00:45:29,737
What?

363
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,423
What is it?
You got a girlfriend or something?

364
00:45:32,656 --> 00:45:34,303
Something like that.

365
00:45:36,256 --> 00:45:37,774
So, how're things in Sidney?

366
00:45:37,825 --> 00:45:39,487
Yeah, it was alright.

367
00:45:39,523 --> 00:45:41,433
And the Uni?
You like it?

368
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,375
Yeah, nice people.

369
00:45:46,764 --> 00:45:49,247
I'm gonna miss that view...

370
00:45:49,611 --> 00:45:51,849
The place is big...

371
00:45:51,969 --> 00:45:54,533
It's very central, lots of space.

372
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:55,816
You have a photograph?

373
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:57,659
Sure, I got plenty of them in the laptop.

374
00:45:57,696 --> 00:46:00,159
Let's see them.

375
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:05,535
I think this is what I'll miss the most.

376
00:46:05,549 --> 00:46:08,144
The sound of it.
Sound of the sea.

377
00:46:08,188 --> 00:46:09,923
Thanks a lot.

378
00:46:11,024 --> 00:46:15,051
I mean apart from the personal things,
obviously.

379
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:26,641
What's the matter, darling?

380
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:32,816
What's the matter?
Are you worried about the move?

381
00:46:33,472 --> 00:46:34,864
Well, yeah.

382
00:46:34,901 --> 00:46:37,534
Is it because Tom's new girlfriend?

383
00:46:40,704 --> 00:46:42,708
How do you know Tom has a new girlfriend?

384
00:46:42,788 --> 00:46:44,891
He just about admitted that much to me...

385
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:48,470
But it's not really the place
to live by his education.

386
00:46:48,732 --> 00:46:53,386
He's got a place right in front of him, one
of the finest drama faculty in the country.

387
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:55,294
Yeah, he knows that.

388
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,750
What is it then?
I've got this fantastic new job...

389
00:46:57,772 --> 00:47:01,157
You don't side by me,
and I feel like an abandon ship.

390
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:04,284
Harold, we don't feel that at all.

391
00:47:05,347 --> 00:47:07,322
You may not, but I do.

392
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:48,285
The house you found is great, Harold.

393
00:47:48,817 --> 00:47:50,501
It's not that.

394
00:48:01,164 --> 00:48:04,333
I don't think we're gonna be able
to come and live in it.

395
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:06,279
Why not?
What's the problem?

396
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,508
Tom and I had a long
talk the other day and...

397
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,902
Neither of us...

398
00:48:14,106 --> 00:48:16,836
Can bear to leave here, not for now.

399
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,307
You made your mind up?

400
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,521
Yeah.

401
00:48:26,366 --> 00:48:27,927
It's got something to do with Lil?

402
00:48:27,933 --> 00:48:30,255
No, it's not of the reasons
you think, Harold...

403
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:32,952
I can't even explain it, it's just I...

404
00:48:33,728 --> 00:48:38,130
Boils down to one simple fact, is that
we can't imagine living anywhere else.

405
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,735
I don't understand.

406
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,854
No, I'm not sure I do.

407
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:53,069
If this fucking house means more to you
than I do...

408
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:55,448
Harold...

409
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,429
I'm sorry.

410
00:49:00,677 --> 00:49:03,111
I really...
I really am.

411
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:18,198
I gotta get rid of Saul.

412
00:49:18,263 --> 00:49:20,399
He keeps hanging around.

413
00:49:21,055 --> 00:49:23,874
I'm afraid he might catch us out or something.

414
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,792
He just need to see us all together,
out and about.

415
00:49:30,485 --> 00:49:32,683
Ever so often, that's all it takes.

416
00:49:32,734 --> 00:49:34,156
Yeah.

417
00:49:36,918 --> 00:49:39,704
I wonder why his wife left him.

418
00:49:39,974 --> 00:49:41,949
It's never a good sign, is it?

419
00:49:48,948 --> 00:49:52,300
I'll fucking kill you!

420
00:49:55,554 --> 00:49:57,121
Oh my god.

421
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:00,968
Roz! They're trying to kill each other!

422
00:50:08,732 --> 00:50:10,707
You fucking coward.

423
00:50:13,403 --> 00:50:14,500
You're nuts.

424
00:50:16,023 --> 00:50:18,224
You're out of fucking mind.

425
00:50:40,234 --> 00:50:41,546
Come on.

426
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:50,453
Hi Saul.

427
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:51,931
Are you alright?

428
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:53,702
Just got caught on the rocks.

429
00:50:53,753 --> 00:50:55,822
It looks nasty,
you might want a tetanus shot.

430
00:50:55,837 --> 00:50:59,285
That's alright, we'll just put some
antiseptic on it. It'll be fine.

431
00:50:59,366 --> 00:51:00,845
We'll see you, Saul.

432
00:51:58,314 --> 00:51:59,837
Where are you going?

433
00:52:00,522 --> 00:52:02,186
To your room.

434
00:52:02,981 --> 00:52:04,730
Ian!

435
00:52:14,185 --> 00:52:15,942
See you at yours.

436
00:52:40,796 --> 00:52:41,903
Lil.

437
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:43,026
Hi.

438
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,013
- Hi, Saul.
- What are you doing?

439
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:46,923
Roz.

440
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,635
Harold's not with you?

441
00:52:48,694 --> 00:52:50,683
No, he's back in Sidney.

442
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,571
Didn't stay long.

443
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,227
Had to get back to work.

444
00:52:58,302 --> 00:53:01,543
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.

445
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:04,364
I wasn't expecting to see you here, Roz.

446
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:09,384
If you'd rather be alone that's fine.

447
00:53:09,413 --> 00:53:11,500
No... No...

448
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,701
- Tea?
- No, I'm fine.

449
00:53:14,131 --> 00:53:17,037
Anyway, I can say what I want to say
in front of Roz.

450
00:53:26,117 --> 00:53:28,948
Lil, I think you know how I feel about you.

451
00:53:29,014 --> 00:53:30,552
I'm in love with you.

452
00:53:30,672 --> 00:53:32,852
I've been in love with you for a while.

453
00:53:33,267 --> 00:53:36,941
And I just thought this might be the moment
where we could discuss our relationship.

454
00:53:42,584 --> 00:53:46,622
I know this is the last thing in the world
you want to hear, so...

455
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,351
But I don't think it's going to work...

456
00:53:49,424 --> 00:53:50,772
I'm asking Lil.

457
00:53:50,892 --> 00:53:52,944
But she's already told you.

458
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:56,623
I think you're gonna have to take no
for an answer.

459
00:53:56,879 --> 00:53:59,356
Yeah Roz, but I want to hear it from Lil.

460
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,515
Don't you think it'd be better
off with a bloke?

461
00:54:05,762 --> 00:54:07,133
I mean both of you.

462
00:54:08,189 --> 00:54:10,625
Two beautiful women like you.

463
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,152
My god.

464
00:54:23,455 --> 00:54:25,532
You must think I'm a fucking idiot.

465
00:54:27,523 --> 00:54:29,257
So that's it.

466
00:54:32,073 --> 00:54:34,435
I don't know what you're talking about.

467
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:38,320
I must have given you a really big laugh.

468
00:54:40,332 --> 00:54:41,739
I'm so sorry.

469
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,967
Saul...

470
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:54,004
Oh my god...

471
00:55:02,665 --> 00:55:04,675
Did you just figure it out?

472
00:55:14,092 --> 00:55:16,541
You might need to be quicker on the mark.

473
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:20,657
- He's gonna tell everyone.
- It's okay, it's probably for the best.

474
00:56:08,415 --> 00:56:09,480
Bastard...

475
00:56:09,531 --> 00:56:11,881
You're going in!

476
00:57:01,344 --> 00:57:05,673
I know that, I don't care if having them
made in China is gonna save us 60%.

477
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,778
Alright.

478
00:57:09,412 --> 00:57:10,556
Alright.

479
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:13,167
We're gonna have to decide
in the next week or two.

480
00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:16,360
Okay, I'll think about it.

481
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:18,860
I'll talk to you again on Monday.

482
00:57:21,185 --> 00:57:24,046
You're alright if I take off now?
I promised to pick up Tom.

483
00:57:24,155 --> 00:57:25,205
Fine.

484
00:57:36,974 --> 00:57:39,349
- See you in the morning, Mr Weston.
- Bye.

485
00:57:57,046 --> 00:57:59,556
Mother, did you not say
to me a little while ago...

486
00:57:59,585 --> 00:58:02,879
That there was nothing in the world that
you would not do for me, if I asked you.

487
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,900
Indeed I did so.

488
00:58:04,943 --> 00:58:06,459
And you'll stick to it, mother?

489
00:58:06,481 --> 00:58:10,552
You may rely on it, my dear and only boy.

490
00:58:10,672 --> 00:58:14,507
I have nothing in the world,
but only you to live along...

491
00:58:14,522 --> 00:58:16,839
Very well.
And I shall hear...

492
00:58:17,867 --> 00:58:20,811
Mother you have a strong and sted-fast mind,
in know.

493
00:58:20,847 --> 00:58:21,678
But now...

494
00:58:21,715 --> 00:58:24,397
Did I say you could invite your mate
to wander in the rehearsal?

495
00:58:26,263 --> 00:58:28,158
Sorry, I just...

496
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:30,993
This is a private work space.

497
00:58:31,343 --> 00:58:33,493
Not fucking movies on a Saturday morning.

498
00:58:33,784 --> 00:58:36,494
I wouldn't have a problem with the guy,
if he was a good director...

499
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:39,633
But he's just such a
fucking wanker, you know?

500
00:58:39,669 --> 00:58:42,715
If he was a good director,
he wouldn't need to throw his weight around.

501
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,071
Yeah.

502
00:58:44,959 --> 00:58:47,228
Hey, dad's offering me
a production down in Sidney.

503
00:58:47,253 --> 00:58:48,371
Oh yeah?

504
00:58:48,472 --> 00:58:51,929
Yeah, the George Gershman story
with second years.

505
00:58:52,213 --> 00:58:53,758
You should take it.

506
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:56,023
I have to be away for at least a month.

507
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:58,080
- So?
- What about Lil?

508
00:58:58,116 --> 00:59:01,165
She'll be fine. She wouldn't want you
to miss an opportunity because of her.

509
00:59:01,201 --> 00:59:02,601
You think?

510
00:59:02,721 --> 00:59:03,956
Absolutely.

511
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:14,779
Thank you.

512
01:01:15,014 --> 01:01:16,469
Can I do that again?

513
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,286
Why?
It was very good.

514
01:01:18,685 --> 01:01:20,253
I can do it better.

515
01:01:32,051 --> 01:01:33,391
Hello?

516
01:01:33,882 --> 01:01:35,580
Hi, darling.

517
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:39,173
No, it's fine. We were just about to eat,
but Roz can dish up.

518
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,199
So, how's it all going?

519
01:01:41,378 --> 01:01:42,632
Yeah?

520
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:45,583
Rehearsals are going well?

521
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,148
Yeah.

522
01:01:47,469 --> 01:01:49,401
The girl playing Roxie is very very good.

523
01:01:49,422 --> 01:01:51,512
She's a really strong performer and...

524
01:01:51,562 --> 01:01:54,249
Seems like she's got quite a lot of potential.

525
01:01:58,479 --> 01:01:59,798
And you're happy?

526
01:01:59,862 --> 01:02:02,051
Yeah, I'm very comfortable.

527
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:05,308
It's been great to get to know
dad's new family and...

528
01:02:05,365 --> 01:02:07,489
He seems very settled.

529
01:02:07,531 --> 01:02:09,156
That's great.

530
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:12,660
Hey look um if you guys are about to eat dinner...

531
01:02:12,681 --> 01:02:14,563
Maybe I should call you back

532
01:02:14,577 --> 01:02:16,930
in an hour or two?

533
01:02:19,196 --> 01:02:20,230
Okay.

534
01:02:20,273 --> 01:02:22,417
Give my love to the others.

535
01:02:23,621 --> 01:02:25,260
And to you.

536
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:28,447
Love you.

537
01:02:30,072 --> 01:02:33,589
He seems very taken with
the girl playing Roxie.

538
01:02:34,124 --> 01:02:36,148
Lil, come on.

539
01:02:36,268 --> 01:02:38,655
I'm sure she's very taken with him too.

540
01:02:38,676 --> 01:02:42,482
If he was taken with her,
I don't think he would've mentioned her.

541
01:02:42,602 --> 01:02:44,527
- Right?
- Exactly.

542
01:02:45,454 --> 01:02:46,502
No.

543
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:49,280
He thinks she's going to be a big star.

544
01:02:51,454 --> 01:02:55,290
There's no where near because...

545
01:02:55,326 --> 01:02:59,643
This big bat...
Was into a...

546
01:03:02,567 --> 01:03:04,827
- You want a drink?
- Love one.

547
01:03:15,573 --> 01:03:16,763
Here.

548
01:03:17,504 --> 01:03:18,843
Thanks.

549
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:31,987
Can I ask you a personal question?

550
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:33,610
Yeah, what?

551
01:03:35,047 --> 01:03:36,527
Are you gay?

552
01:03:42,384 --> 01:03:43,864
I'm afraid not.

553
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:54,316
Hey I hear really good reports coming out
of the rehearsal room.

554
01:03:54,436 --> 01:03:56,137
Happy to hear it.

555
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,832
Look at you, Dad.

556
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:06,302
So everything worked out for the best.

557
01:04:07,103 --> 01:04:09,802
Everything just works
out the way it's gonna...

558
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:13,817
We just plod along behind it and
try and keep up.

559
01:04:14,216 --> 01:04:17,543
You're not still angry with mom, are you?

560
01:04:20,697 --> 01:04:23,464
God no, no...

561
01:04:25,927 --> 01:04:27,226
You know?

562
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:34,907
Soon enough I won't let
you see me like this.

563
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:38,510
I don't you to even think about getting old.

564
01:04:39,642 --> 01:04:42,401
That'll happen whether
I think about it or not.

565
01:04:42,415 --> 01:04:43,640
No.

566
01:04:43,818 --> 01:04:45,291
I won't let it.

567
01:04:47,877 --> 01:04:50,909
You can't stop it, Ian.
It's going to happen.

568
01:04:51,315 --> 01:04:52,384
Please.

569
01:04:58,646 --> 01:05:01,280
Okay, I won't get old.
Will that do you?

570
01:05:01,743 --> 01:05:02,561
Yeah.

571
01:05:06,408 --> 01:05:09,083
You're crazy.
We're both crazy.

572
01:05:13,986 --> 01:05:15,915
Come on, it's not me.

573
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,325
I'm not.

574
01:05:20,693 --> 01:05:22,018
Yeah...

575
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:23,720
I really think we should go home.

576
01:05:23,734 --> 01:05:25,685
I think we should hit the road.

577
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,037
No way, come one.
One more, one more for the road.

578
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,653
Come on, please...

579
01:05:30,689 --> 01:05:31,814
Alright, I'll get them.

580
01:05:31,843 --> 01:05:34,086
No, I'll get them.
My shout, my idea.

581
01:05:34,107 --> 01:05:36,229
Get out of the way, I'm driving.

582
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,485
- Guess what? I'm not. Tequila for you?
- No.

583
01:05:41,784 --> 01:05:43,110
I've never seen her like this.

584
01:05:43,153 --> 01:05:44,712
She's panicking.

585
01:05:44,734 --> 01:05:47,796
Hi, could I get a 2 gin and tonics
and a beer?

586
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:49,449
And a tequila shot please?

587
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:50,781
I'll pay for those, mate.

588
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:52,112
What?

589
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,028
What's your name?

590
01:05:55,063 --> 01:05:56,558
- I'm Lil.
- Hi Lil.

591
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,231
- Thanks.
- I'm Richard.

592
01:05:58,438 --> 01:06:01,414
Hi... Nice to meet you.

593
01:06:01,464 --> 01:06:03,483
Well, what do you know?
Chivalry's not dead.

594
01:06:03,508 --> 01:06:04,708
I'm so proud of it.

595
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:08,341
You need a hand?

596
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:10,912
No, I'm okay.
This...

597
01:06:10,961 --> 01:06:14,277
Lovely gentleman seems to
want to buy us the drinks.

598
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:16,107
- That's alright.
- Who are you?

599
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:17,552
I'm her son.

600
01:06:17,927 --> 01:06:19,422
Thanks.

601
01:06:19,714 --> 01:06:21,487
Well, no harm done, sonny.

602
01:06:21,537 --> 01:06:23,331
You better run along now.

603
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,059
That's what you called a buzz-kill.

604
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:31,725
I assure you, I had him when I was 3.

605
01:06:34,854 --> 01:06:36,662
Hey, what's the matter?

606
01:06:36,705 --> 01:06:38,640
Nothing, I was having fun.

607
01:06:38,842 --> 01:06:41,883
I don't know why you had to go and
stick your beak in, he was a good bloke.

608
01:06:41,933 --> 01:06:43,058
Mom.

609
01:06:44,454 --> 01:06:46,256
- Bye.
- I'll see you.

610
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,128
Bye.

611
01:06:51,186 --> 01:06:54,632
At some point, I gotta learn
to live my own life.

612
01:06:56,488 --> 01:06:58,203
Two days, mom.

613
01:06:58,323 --> 01:07:00,403
- He's back in two days.
- I know.

614
01:07:15,889 --> 01:07:17,639
Are you coming in?

615
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:20,123
Just for a few minutes.

616
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:23,067
Roz expecting you?

617
01:07:24,284 --> 01:07:25,644
I think so.

618
01:07:26,328 --> 01:07:27,375
Come on.

619
01:07:32,914 --> 01:07:35,378
Don't let me keep you, darling.

620
01:07:36,275 --> 01:07:38,568
I'll stay as long as you like.

621
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:43,665
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise.

622
01:09:24,465 --> 01:09:25,975
Very nice.

623
01:09:41,047 --> 01:09:43,282
Are you hungry?
Ready for yum-yums?

624
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:48,847
I don't see why you have to rush off
in such a hurry.

625
01:09:48,881 --> 01:09:52,431
Stick around for a few days and
luxuriate in your triumph.

626
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,083
Stay for the weekend, at least.

627
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,562
No, I've got to get back.

628
01:09:56,181 --> 01:09:58,059
You got a girl waiting, is that it?

629
01:09:58,108 --> 01:09:59,119
Not a girl.

630
01:10:00,234 --> 01:10:02,119
Just some stuff I gotta do.

631
01:10:03,957 --> 01:10:06,083
I'm coming up to you 21st.

632
01:10:06,145 --> 01:10:09,383
If I'm still welcome up there, that is.

633
01:10:10,278 --> 01:10:11,660
Don't be stupid.

634
01:10:12,569 --> 01:10:14,223
I won't miss that.

635
01:10:14,532 --> 01:10:17,030
Key to the door, all that stuff.

636
01:10:18,722 --> 01:10:20,884
What do you reckon, Dad?
Is the door worth opening?

637
01:10:20,904 --> 01:10:22,417
It's gonna open anyway,

638
01:10:22,797 --> 01:10:26,167
so you might as well walk through
there with a big smile on your face.

639
01:10:49,932 --> 01:10:52,182
God, you're beautiful.

640
01:11:23,933 --> 01:11:26,110
So do you want to do another musical?

641
01:11:28,036 --> 01:11:30,257
I rather do a play next.

642
01:11:30,305 --> 01:11:31,846
Something contemporary.

643
01:11:31,915 --> 01:11:33,800
Sounds like a good idea.

644
01:11:33,821 --> 01:11:36,578
But the fact of the matter is,
for the next few years...

645
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,876
I just have to take whatever
I get offered.

646
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:41,096
I don't really have a choice.

647
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:43,738
I'll get it.

648
01:11:47,485 --> 01:11:48,827
Hello?

649
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:50,795
Hi.

650
01:11:52,982 --> 01:11:55,776
Yeah, of course I was expecting you.

651
01:11:58,156 --> 01:11:59,532
Yeah, I'm good.

652
01:12:03,891 --> 01:12:05,109
Yeah.

653
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:07,989
What happened?

654
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,750
Hi Harold.

655
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:25,569
How are you going?

656
01:12:25,617 --> 01:12:26,360
Roz.

657
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

658
01:12:29,055 --> 01:12:30,561
This is Mary.

659
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:31,848
- Hi.
- Hi.

660
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:33,279
I'm Roz.

661
01:12:33,368 --> 01:12:34,809
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

662
01:12:34,836 --> 01:12:38,224
Baby was teething, grizzling along,
Molly thought she'd stay behind...

663
01:12:38,244 --> 01:12:41,726
and I thought I'd bring the
birthday boy a nice surprise.

664
01:12:41,753 --> 01:12:43,645
Nothing like a nice surprise.

665
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,221
It's great.

666
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:53,873
- Cheers.
- Cheers, darling.

667
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:12,468
Mary.
This is Lil and Ian.

668
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,532
Hi, I've heard so much about you.

669
01:14:14,573 --> 01:14:18,435
I wish I could say the same
but Tom's a bit of a secretive bugger.

670
01:14:23,471 --> 01:14:25,149
Would you like to dance?

671
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:26,876
Sure, thanks.

672
01:14:27,474 --> 01:14:28,582
Happy birthday.

673
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:30,034
Thanks, man.

674
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:34,556
Come on, Harold.

675
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,506
- Come, indulge me.
- No, Roz.

676
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:39,072
- Come on.
- Please.

677
01:14:51,088 --> 01:14:53,393
She's staying in a hotel.

678
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:55,808
I could drop her home and then come by.

679
01:14:55,835 --> 01:14:57,203
If you want.

680
01:14:59,322 --> 01:15:01,813
I don't think that's such a good idea.

681
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:48,897
Coming in?

682
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:52,241
I don't know.

683
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:57,087
Don't you want your extra
special birthday present?

684
01:15:57,623 --> 01:15:59,137
Yeah, of course.

685
01:16:14,015 --> 01:16:16,506
I think this is what
we've been dreading, Lil.

686
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:21,580
We have to bow out.

687
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:31,059
Lil...

688
01:16:42,794 --> 01:16:45,231
I don't know if I could bear it.

689
01:16:45,293 --> 01:16:46,669
I know.

690
01:16:47,509 --> 01:16:48,823
We have to.

691
01:16:56,982 --> 01:16:59,906
I have to, you don't.

692
01:17:00,099 --> 01:17:01,793
Ian doesn't have a girlfriend.

693
01:17:01,814 --> 01:17:04,360
I know, but he should have.
Shouldn't he?

694
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:08,568
Yeah.

695
01:17:09,724 --> 01:17:11,437
I supposed he should.

696
01:17:25,965 --> 01:17:27,947
We have to stand together.

697
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,282
Okay?

698
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,789
- Yeah.
- And put an end to it.

699
01:17:37,312 --> 01:17:38,647
Yeah.

700
01:17:41,626 --> 01:17:43,428
We just have to.

701
01:17:45,864 --> 01:17:47,494
I know we do.

702
01:17:58,078 --> 01:18:00,955
I don't see why what Tom gets up to
has anything to do with us.

703
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:03,302
- I'm not getting married.
- Who says I'm getting married?

704
01:18:03,343 --> 01:18:05,269
Then, I'm not doing whatever
it is you're doing.

705
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:08,405
Fucking someone else, I'm not doing that.
I have no intention of doing that.

706
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,344
All right, Ian, that's enough.

707
01:18:10,365 --> 01:18:12,043
It doesn't matter.

708
01:18:13,241 --> 01:18:15,188
This has gone on long enough.

709
01:18:17,038 --> 01:18:19,254
Why can't you leave things as they are?

710
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,491
It's all going to be fine.

711
01:18:23,489 --> 01:18:25,498
We're going to be respectable...

712
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:28,185
Pillars of the community from here on end.

713
01:18:29,073 --> 01:18:31,653
And we'll be model mothers-in-laws...

714
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:34,923
And before you know it,
we'll be the perfect grandmothers.

715
01:18:36,656 --> 01:18:38,847
I will never forgive you for this.

716
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,367
I'm so sorry.

717
01:19:09,905 --> 01:19:11,377
No, darling.

718
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:17,017
It was going to happen sooner or later.

719
01:19:29,804 --> 01:19:32,363
And responsibly and joyfully...

720
01:19:32,721 --> 01:19:36,436
In mutual respect
and the promise to be faithful...

721
01:19:37,138 --> 01:19:39,546
Come together in the presence of God...

722
01:19:39,766 --> 01:19:43,137
To witness the marriage of Tom and Mary.

723
01:19:43,257 --> 01:19:47,126
And to ask God's blessing on them
as we share their joy.

724
01:19:47,745 --> 01:19:51,039
Marriage is a gift of God, our creator.

725
01:19:51,128 --> 01:19:55,018
It is a symbol of God's
unending love for his people...

726
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:58,765
and of the union between
Christ and His church.

727
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:02,101
Christ loved his bride, the church.

728
01:20:02,122 --> 01:20:04,475
And gave Himself for her.

729
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:07,680
As He has called Tom
and Mary to marriage...

730
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:11,223
So He draws their different
gifts and hopes.

731
01:20:11,278 --> 01:20:14,484
Into the unity of love and service.

732
01:20:18,362 --> 01:20:20,797
Relax, it'll be your turn next.

733
01:20:20,845 --> 01:20:21,698
Yeah?

734
01:20:21,712 --> 01:20:24,585
Many good things about being married.

735
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:27,956
You're the one to blame
for this, aren't you?

736
01:20:28,011 --> 01:20:31,006
I thought you were supposed to praise
the fairy godmother.

737
01:20:31,041 --> 01:20:32,451
Not blame them.

738
01:20:32,513 --> 01:20:35,456
Yeah, don't wave your
fucking wand over me.

739
01:20:42,598 --> 01:20:45,245
Hello.
Nice to see you again.

740
01:20:45,775 --> 01:20:47,591
You look lovely.

741
01:21:37,764 --> 01:21:40,344
Hi, can I get a champagne?
Thank you.

742
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:47,636
Hey, hey...

743
01:21:49,893 --> 01:21:51,218
Are you alright?

744
01:21:51,562 --> 01:21:52,588
Fine, why?

745
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:53,998
You're just...

746
01:21:54,025 --> 01:21:55,966
You seem a bit morose, that's all.

747
01:21:57,816 --> 01:22:01,366
No, just occasions like
these make you think...

748
01:22:01,612 --> 01:22:03,868
I hope they do better than us.

749
01:22:03,889 --> 01:22:05,169
Don't you?

750
01:22:06,698 --> 01:22:08,858
Yeah, of course.

751
01:22:12,278 --> 01:22:13,881
Just wondering.

752
01:22:44,275 --> 01:22:45,679
Where's mom?

753
01:22:46,202 --> 01:22:47,750
She went home.

754
01:22:48,115 --> 01:22:49,670
Retired hurt?

755
01:22:50,837 --> 01:22:51,973
If you like.

756
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,638
I don't like.

757
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:08,748
Why did you want to ruin everything?

758
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,695
I didn't want to.

759
01:23:51,742 --> 01:23:52,981
Roz.

760
01:24:00,044 --> 01:24:01,826
Roz, are you there?

761
01:24:04,887 --> 01:24:06,480
Roz, let me in.

762
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:10,801
Roz?

763
01:24:19,446 --> 01:24:20,877
Roz!

764
01:24:21,276 --> 01:24:22,878
Let me in!

765
01:25:22,388 --> 01:25:24,548
It's just up here on the right.

766
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:26,963
I think he's still sleeping.

767
01:25:26,991 --> 01:25:29,316
Wait, you go in.
I'll wait.

768
01:25:29,351 --> 01:25:31,669
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, he might not want to see me.

769
01:25:32,266 --> 01:25:33,945
If he does, come get me.

770
01:25:34,165 --> 01:25:35,775
Alright.

771
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:53,466
Hi, darling.

772
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:55,929
Hey.

773
01:25:59,146 --> 01:26:01,038
How are you feeling?

774
01:26:09,376 --> 01:26:11,132
Doctor said you'll live.

775
01:26:12,708 --> 01:26:14,662
Do they have any good news?

776
01:26:21,974 --> 01:26:23,693
Roz is here.

777
01:26:24,148 --> 01:26:25,992
She'd love to see you.

778
01:26:26,582 --> 01:26:28,572
- No.
- Darling, she's...

779
01:26:28,597 --> 01:26:29,397
No.

780
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:32,725
Hi.

781
01:26:36,515 --> 01:26:37,661
Hi.

782
01:26:43,551 --> 01:26:44,842
That's good.

783
01:26:46,148 --> 01:26:48,740
I'm better than those fucking crutches.

784
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:51,801
I can get you some softer ones.

785
01:26:53,102 --> 01:26:55,293
I don't know why I bother.

786
01:26:58,363 --> 01:27:01,594
They say your spine is gonna be okay,
so that's good, right?

787
01:27:01,852 --> 01:27:05,609
Yeah, only a comparison to what
they're telling me about my leg.

788
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:10,474
Just a bit left.

789
01:27:14,461 --> 01:27:15,833
Roz?

790
01:27:19,554 --> 01:27:20,763
Hey...

791
01:27:22,246 --> 01:27:23,802
What?

792
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:27,566
You were calling out for Roz.

793
01:27:31,571 --> 01:27:33,857
Were you dreaming about her?

794
01:27:36,075 --> 01:27:37,661
I guess so.

795
01:27:40,076 --> 01:27:42,692
It's not surprising, really.

796
01:27:44,122 --> 01:27:46,409
I've known her my whole life.

797
01:27:47,906 --> 01:27:49,506
She's been like...

798
01:27:50,885 --> 01:27:52,967
Second mother to me.

799
01:28:03,518 --> 01:28:05,532
What would I do without you?

800
01:28:10,667 --> 01:28:13,278
I ssume that you'll be moving to Sidney?

801
01:28:13,732 --> 01:28:15,370
I like it here.

802
01:28:15,805 --> 01:28:17,398
I know, but...

803
01:28:17,435 --> 01:28:19,729
I have to travel where the work is...

804
01:28:19,950 --> 01:28:23,078
Mary's the same, so we can
base ourselves where we like.

805
01:28:24,059 --> 01:28:26,237
- Where is she now?
- Audition.

806
01:28:29,634 --> 01:28:32,304
How's it going with Hannah?

807
01:28:32,341 --> 01:28:33,787
It's going...

808
01:28:34,237 --> 01:28:35,690
Nowhere.

809
01:28:36,995 --> 01:28:38,161
She's great.

810
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:40,351
She couldn't be nicer, I just...

811
01:28:41,965 --> 01:28:43,890
- You know.
- Yeah.

812
01:28:46,714 --> 01:28:49,628
Pretty soon I'm gonna
have to give her the elbow.

813
01:29:04,813 --> 01:29:06,516
- Hello.
- Hi.

814
01:29:06,671 --> 01:29:08,010
What are you doing here?

815
01:29:09,839 --> 01:29:11,897
I didn't want to tell you over the phone.

816
01:29:12,856 --> 01:29:14,287
Tell me what?

817
01:29:15,467 --> 01:29:17,142
I'm pregnant.

818
01:29:20,738 --> 01:29:22,110
Hey...

819
01:30:21,838 --> 01:30:24,360
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

820
01:30:29,553 --> 01:30:33,488
I think you don't need these wings to swim.

821
01:30:33,923 --> 01:30:35,989
You're gonna be able
to do it all by yourself.

822
01:30:36,194 --> 01:30:38,036
I know you will, ready?
Off you go.

823
01:31:28,565 --> 01:31:30,582
Take your glasses off.

824
01:31:31,630 --> 01:31:34,245
I don't like you hiding your eyes from me.

825
01:31:59,969 --> 01:32:02,460
Don't go in the water by yourself.

826
01:32:02,524 --> 01:32:03,802
What's going on?

827
01:32:03,859 --> 01:32:05,845
She's going to the water again.

828
01:32:05,903 --> 01:32:07,546
You've frighten her.

829
01:32:08,616 --> 01:32:12,119
- Can't you see she's frighten?
- I want my granny!

830
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:23,809
Is this your hat?

831
01:32:23,845 --> 01:32:26,573
- Yeah...
- It's my hat.

832
01:32:34,144 --> 01:32:37,043
I don't think I have any plain bread.

833
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:38,522
Red and white.

834
01:32:38,565 --> 01:32:41,670
Finish them all.

835
01:32:45,229 --> 01:32:46,415
Those were the best ones.

836
01:32:46,448 --> 01:32:48,328
You've probably have had
enough sun for one day.

837
01:32:48,468 --> 01:32:50,312
That's okay, I'll take them up
in a minute.

838
01:32:50,337 --> 01:32:52,532
That's alright, I'll do it.

839
01:32:55,262 --> 01:32:56,398
Come on.

840
01:32:56,464 --> 01:32:58,126
Sweetie...

841
01:32:58,743 --> 01:33:01,378
Why are we leaving?
No no no...

842
01:33:01,403 --> 01:33:03,531
Take the lolly.

843
01:33:03,651 --> 01:33:05,718
Granny!

844
01:33:05,838 --> 01:33:07,198
That's alright.

845
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:10,128
Where's my granny?

846
01:33:10,613 --> 01:33:12,965
You got them over excited.

847
01:33:13,741 --> 01:33:16,103
No, we spoil them, it's what we do.

848
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:18,865
It's what grandmothers supposed to do.

849
01:33:22,453 --> 01:33:25,492
You two are really pleased
with yourselves, aren't you?

850
01:33:31,386 --> 01:33:34,079
At our beach, at our magic beach...

851
01:33:34,145 --> 01:33:36,737
The old bed is cozy and white...

852
01:33:36,774 --> 01:33:40,528
To the sound of the ocean,
we sleep through the night.

853
01:33:41,795 --> 01:33:45,130
Adrift on the evening tide.

854
01:33:45,972 --> 01:33:47,261
That's it.

855
01:33:50,088 --> 01:33:51,260
Night night...

856
01:34:00,324 --> 01:34:03,626
I'm exhausted, you don't mind
if I skip dinner, do you?

857
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,775
No, I will miss you.

858
01:34:06,266 --> 01:34:07,848
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

859
01:34:07,899 --> 01:34:09,079
Sweet dreams.

860
01:34:09,116 --> 01:34:11,115
Night night, guys.

861
01:34:11,173 --> 01:34:13,914
So how long are you guys on the road for?

862
01:34:14,258 --> 01:34:18,089
I think I'm on the road for less than 6 weeks,
and you go back on...

863
01:34:18,148 --> 01:34:19,971
Wednesday.

864
01:34:20,462 --> 01:34:22,771
I can't believe the break's
gone by so fast.

865
01:34:23,335 --> 01:34:24,704
Will I see you before you go?

866
01:34:24,726 --> 01:34:26,300
- Yeah, I hope so.
- Good.

867
01:34:26,682 --> 01:34:28,366
- See you.
- Night.

868
01:34:28,762 --> 01:34:29,846
Bye.

869
01:34:32,346 --> 01:34:33,613
Bye, guys.

870
01:34:33,664 --> 01:34:35,444
- Bye, love.
- Bye mom.

871
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,479
No, it's great.

872
01:35:00,998 --> 01:35:03,541
The only problem is now that
they built my part more and more,

873
01:35:03,962 --> 01:35:06,271
learning the lines everyday.
It's murder.

874
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,558
Ken Pierce, he plays my dad, they had to...

875
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,984
Do this storyline about
him going deaf so they

876
01:35:12,195 --> 01:35:14,075
can give him an ear piece
and feed him his lines.

877
01:35:14,444 --> 01:35:16,616
Ah, so that's why he looks
so bewildered all the time.

878
01:35:16,651 --> 01:35:19,408
I think he's pretty bewildered
at the best of times.

879
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:25,366
Why don't you all drive back to
the hotel together? Ian can drive.

880
01:35:25,383 --> 01:35:26,467
Why is that?

881
01:35:26,877 --> 01:35:29,901
- I think you've had a bit of drink.
- I'm alright.

882
01:35:30,253 --> 01:35:32,286
You must be over the limit, Tom.

883
01:35:33,063 --> 01:35:34,527
Yeah, probably.

884
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,420
Alright, I'll go for a walk
and sober up a bit.

885
01:35:37,441 --> 01:35:39,499
- No, I'll drive.
- That's fine.

886
01:35:39,619 --> 01:35:43,081
You stay and chat,
I'm gonna get a breath of fresh air.

887
01:35:43,323 --> 01:35:45,271
Do you girls want to go shopping tomorrow?

888
01:35:45,307 --> 01:35:47,717
- That sounds good.
- Go to that dress shop.

889
01:36:40,564 --> 01:36:42,740
Great idea.

890
01:36:46,357 --> 01:36:48,503
I want to speak to you, in private.

891
01:36:48,525 --> 01:36:50,158
- Ian...
- Now!

892
01:36:56,909 --> 01:36:58,956
I'll kill him!

893
01:36:59,593 --> 01:37:01,644
They really took you for a ride,
didn't they?

894
01:37:01,687 --> 01:37:04,048
You're telling me you never
even suspected them?

895
01:37:04,224 --> 01:37:06,604
How could you have been so stupid?

896
01:37:07,461 --> 01:37:10,282
You made a stop when we didn't have to.

897
01:37:11,072 --> 01:37:14,262
And all the time they,
Tom who was getting married.

898
01:37:14,298 --> 01:37:17,279
For fuck sake, and should have stopped,
they were just stringing you along,

899
01:37:17,341 --> 01:37:18,621
they were just pretending...

900
01:37:18,656 --> 01:37:21,910
And having sex whenever they felt like it,
and laughing at us behind our backs.

901
01:37:21,947 --> 01:37:24,197
And you're saying you had no idea
what was going on?

902
01:37:24,222 --> 01:37:24,825
That's enough.

903
01:37:24,826 --> 01:37:27,027
- Ian, we are not alone.
- What difference does it make?

904
01:37:28,452 --> 01:37:31,103
Ian, what are you taking about?

905
01:37:36,401 --> 01:37:38,452
I just walked across the
street and found your

906
01:37:38,716 --> 01:37:40,987
husband rolling around on the floor
with my mother.

907
01:37:41,012 --> 01:37:42,212
What?

908
01:37:43,137 --> 01:37:44,712
- You heard me.
- Ian...

909
01:37:44,887 --> 01:37:47,622
Don't fucking Ian me...

910
01:37:48,207 --> 01:37:50,002
As far as I'm concerned...

911
01:37:50,851 --> 01:37:52,859
This is all your fault.

912
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:57,452
How could it be her fault?

913
01:38:02,805 --> 01:38:04,665
Don't you see, Hannah?

914
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:07,287
They're lovers as well.

915
01:38:12,927 --> 01:38:14,186
Ian?

916
01:38:17,899 --> 01:38:19,739
It's not true, is it?

917
01:38:20,647 --> 01:38:22,763
Not anymore.

918
01:38:23,869 --> 01:38:25,758
She put a stop to it.

919
01:38:28,819 --> 01:38:31,372
I don't understand.

920
01:38:35,937 --> 01:38:38,097
It couldn't be simpler.

921
01:38:40,675 --> 01:38:42,835
My husband has betrayed me.

922
01:38:42,915 --> 01:38:45,156
Lied to me from day one.

923
01:38:46,181 --> 01:38:48,114
I'm gonna go and get Alice.

924
01:38:48,158 --> 01:38:51,650
And leave and I never want
to see any of you ever again.

925
01:38:52,441 --> 01:38:55,224
If you have any sense,
you'll come with me.

926
01:39:03,154 --> 01:39:04,918
Go on, then.

927
01:39:19,007 --> 01:39:21,775
Well I hope you're pleased with yourself.

928
01:39:24,653 --> 01:39:26,901
I just told the truth.

929
01:39:28,095 --> 01:39:29,591
That's all.

930
01:39:30,968 --> 01:39:32,264
That's all?

931
01:39:33,774 --> 01:39:36,666
And you think that's something
to be proud of?

932
01:39:38,314 --> 01:39:39,588
Somebody had to.

933
01:39:39,603 --> 01:39:43,455
No! Nobody had to unless they wanted to
cause as much damage as possible, Ian.

934
01:39:43,506 --> 01:39:44,801
Especially to Hannah.

935
01:39:44,919 --> 01:39:47,269
It wasn't going anywhere anyway.

936
01:39:49,239 --> 01:39:51,396
Probably best to make it quick and...

937
01:39:52,568 --> 01:39:54,047
Merciful?

938
01:39:54,648 --> 01:39:56,763
Is that your idea of merciful?

939
01:40:12,724 --> 01:40:15,968
- Granny...
- Don't you touch her.

940
01:40:16,349 --> 01:40:17,951
Granny...

941
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:24,707
You're worse than he is, you know that?

942
01:40:25,835 --> 01:40:27,776
Tell Tom to stay away.

943
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:29,516
I don't wanna see him.

944
01:40:29,838 --> 01:40:31,273
I'll tell him.

945
01:40:39,553 --> 01:40:41,515
Bye-bye sweetie.

946
01:41:53,209 --> 01:41:55,425
I don't think they're coming back.

947
01:42:08,819 --> 01:42:10,914
We did try, Roz.

948
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:17,135
We really did,
we stopped the same time you did.

949
01:42:17,838 --> 01:42:19,771
We thought that was that.

950
01:42:27,265 --> 01:42:28,598
And then...

951
01:42:29,579 --> 01:42:31,695
We started it again just...

952
01:42:32,379 --> 01:42:34,495
A few weeks after the wedding.

953
01:42:34,993 --> 01:42:37,774
Mary was away auditioning and...

954
01:42:38,748 --> 01:42:41,040
Tom dropped by.

955
01:42:41,098 --> 01:42:42,902
The way he always did.

956
01:42:44,462 --> 01:42:47,472
And it just sort of happened.

957
01:42:48,721 --> 01:42:51,606
I didn't tell you because I thought...

958
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:55,087
It wasn't gonna last.

959
01:42:56,332 --> 01:42:58,880
And then once we both realized it...

960
01:42:59,358 --> 01:43:00,808
was.

961
01:43:03,825 --> 01:43:06,405
It's just seem too late to tell you.

962
01:43:07,364 --> 01:43:09,041
Too hurtful.

963
01:43:12,123 --> 01:43:14,774
After the way you sacrificed Ian.

964
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:19,071
And Tom really didn't want me to tell you.

965
01:43:19,949 --> 01:43:21,469
Because it was...

966
01:43:21,622 --> 01:43:23,109
It was so...

967
01:43:23,746 --> 01:43:25,716
Casual, you know?

968
01:43:30,461 --> 01:43:34,291
Sometimes we went weeks
without it, months...

969
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:43,374
It was just...

970
01:43:44,033 --> 01:43:48,687
It was just important for us to
know that it hadn't gone away.

971
01:43:51,034 --> 01:43:53,787
That it was still alive.

972
01:43:57,083 --> 01:44:01,321
Christ, I felt like I would
suffocate if didn't have it.

973
01:44:06,481 --> 01:44:10,986
Then it was only possible with
Tom because he's so light, so easy.

974
01:44:11,015 --> 01:44:13,735
It couldn't have worked that way with Ian.

975
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:24,262
Ian told me it was all my fault.

976
01:44:24,299 --> 01:44:27,601
Oh for God sake, he doesn't
know what's he talking about.

977
01:44:30,052 --> 01:44:34,137
You're the only one who
hasn't behaved badly.

978
01:44:36,861 --> 01:44:39,632
Then it probably is all my fault.

979
01:44:45,269 --> 01:44:46,822
Oh Roz.

980
01:45:40,252 --> 01:45:41,988
Morning.

981
